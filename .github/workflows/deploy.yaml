## Production Deployment Branch - \`prod-page\`

# This branch contains the **production-ready build** of the Typing-Test app, deployed to GitHub Pages.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Do NOT create pull requests to or from this branch.**  
  This branch is automatically updated by GitHub Actions workflows during deployment.

- **Do NOT commit directly to this branch.**  
  All changes should be made on the \`main\` branch (or other development branches), then deployed via the workflow.

- This branch is **managed automatically** by the deployment process and should be considered **read-only** for contributors.

---

## Purpose

- Hosts the built Angular app for GitHub Pages at:  
  \`https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Typing-Test/\`

- Keeps deployment history clean by using force pushes via automation.
